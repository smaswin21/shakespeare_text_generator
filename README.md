## Project Overview
This project implements a text generation model that mimics William Shakespeare's style using **N-gram models (bigrams, trigrams, quadgrams, etc.)**. The model is trained on Shakespeare's works and can generate new text based on an initial phrase.

---

## Approach

1. **Preprocess the Text:** Convert to lowercase, remove punctuation, and tokenize.
2. **Create N-Grams:** Construct bigrams, trigrams, and quadgrams from the text.
3. **Compute Token Counts & Probabilities:** Build frequency distributions for next-word predictions.
4. **Generate Text:** Given an initial phrase, predict the next word probabilistically and iteratively build a sequence.
5. **Evaluate Model Performance:** Compare different N-gram models and conduct human evaluations.
